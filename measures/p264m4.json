    "intro": "Corinthia is a toolkit/application for converting between and editing common office file formats, with an initial focus on word processing. It is designed to cater for multiple classes of platforms - desktop, web, and mobile - and relies heavily on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for representing and manipulating documents. The toolkit is small, portable, and flexible, with minimal dependencies. The target audience is developers wishing to include office viewing, conversion, and editing functionality into their applications. Retired for lack of activity",
