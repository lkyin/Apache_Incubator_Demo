    "intro": "Stonehenge is a set of interoperability scenarios for Service Oriented Architecture and Web Services that demonstrate interoperability between multiple systems including Apache Axis2, WSF/PHP and Microsoft WCF. The code also demonstrates good practice for standards-based interoperability.     \"The Stonehenge project pretty much accomplished what it originally    set out to do and then really didn't find a way to transition to    something that is longer lasting and able to develop a community    around it.\"",
